I just would like to share the useful QGIS webinar for water people.

Last August, I was in FOSS4G 2019 Bucharest and attended the workshop of "QGIS and Hydrological Applications" by Mr. Hans from IHE Delft university.

It was extremely useful for me to know new functions of QGIS for these purpose of hydrological analysys.

Recently, I knew he is doing 7 times of free Webinar for "QGIS and Hydrological Applications" at 9 pm in Netherlands time every Friday.

Yesterday, It was the third webinar. Even though it is too difficult to join it from Japan because of timezone, I also followed previous video of 1st and 2nd webinar.

I think these contents of his webinar are quite useful for people who is working in water sector in developping countries.
