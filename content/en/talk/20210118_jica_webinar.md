## Summary

I presented "A case study of Open Source GIS in rural water management in Rwanda" in JICA webinar. I introduced what we developed in Rwanda and what we are doing for rural water management by using open source GIS now. Also we focused our future planning of development for next phase GIS system in WASAC, Rwanda. In webinar, we presented in Japanese language together with French interpreter.

The title in French was "Etude de cas sur l’exploitation du WebSIG pour l’approvisionnement en eau en milieu rural par l’intégration du logiciel à code source ouverte au Rwanda"

In presentation day, there were two Rwandan colleagues from WASAC joined as observor, it was really successful.
