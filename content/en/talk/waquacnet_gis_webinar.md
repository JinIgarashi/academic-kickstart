## Abstract
GIS systems are widely used in the water supply field in the world. However, most of GIS systems have high    license fees and training costs for development, maintenance, and operation, and there are not many examples of effective use in the water supply utilities in general. Mr. Igarashi , lecturer will introduce a low-cost, easy-to-build GIS system that uses open source technology called Vector Tiles. He built it in Kenya and Rwanda as a GIS system that can be accessed by all staff of water utilities.
