## Abstract

In Eastern Africa, most of water utilities already have some GIS data. However, they often have some challenges to utilize and share the data within the entire organization. I was involved the projects in Kenya and Rwanda since 2014. Recently, I found a sustainable way to share GIS data through vector tiles as open data. I would like to introduce these open source tools which I developed for them. 
The following website is a documentation for my open source softwares.
