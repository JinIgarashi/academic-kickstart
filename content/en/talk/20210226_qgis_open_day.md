## Summary

I joined Mr. Hans's session on QGIS Open Day, its title was [Open Education for QGIS](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QHF-February-2021#open-education-for-qgis). Last year, I translated some training materials of [GIS OpenCourseWare](https://courses.gisopencourseware.org) which Mr. Hans launched for open education. I am also translater for both [QField](https://qfield.org) and [Input](https://inputapp.io) mobile applicaiton. I told my motivation for traslating QGIS related documents and softwares.
