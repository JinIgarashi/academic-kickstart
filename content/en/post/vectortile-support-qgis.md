I met people from Lutraconsulting which contributes a lot for QGIS at FOSS4G Bucharest in last year.

I found they are doing crowdfunding to develop native support of vector tile on QGIS.

Recently, I started to work with OneCompath company in Tokyo, then I am using Mapbox Vector Tile. Nowadays, MVT became more and more popular. I believed this development will contribute a lot for FOSS4G comunity.

Their website of crowdfunding is [here](https://www.lutraconsulting.co.uk/crowdfunding/vectortile-qgis/). The crowdfunding will close after two weeks from now.

As an individual, I also contributed 100EUR for this project...
