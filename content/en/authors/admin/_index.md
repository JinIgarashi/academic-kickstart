Jin IGARASHI is Senior software engineer specializing in GIS, water and sanitation fields with more than 13 years of work experience in Japan and Eastern Africa. Holding MSc (Eng) on Water, Sanitation and Health Engineering degree with distinction from the University of Leeds, United Kingdom. Developed various GIS applications in Fujitsu at the beginning of my career in Japan. Then, worked in Eastern Africa (Kenya and Rwanda) for water assets management and Non-Revenue Water (NRW) management as a GIS specialist in Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)’s projects. During JICA projects’ period, I developed several open source software to support them to manage water assets, these activities now become GIS for Water organization in GitHub, and I am maintaining this software.

Academically, I studied full lifecyle costs of urban sanitation systems as my MSc dissertation. I conducted data collection in Narok town, Kenya, analysed and estimated how much was the life cycle costs across the entire sanitation value chain (transport from households to treatment facilities and dispose human excreta).
Because of my experience of GIS and water & sanitation, I am very much interested in working in the water sector in developing countries by applying GIS technologies.
