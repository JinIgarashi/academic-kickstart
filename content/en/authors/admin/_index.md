Jin IGARASHI is Senior software engineer specializing in GIS field more than 10 years of work experience in Japan and Eastern Africa. Developed various GIS applications in Fujitsu at the beginning of my career in Japan. Then, worked in Eastern Africa (Kenya and Rwanda) for water supply management as GIS specialist. Developed GIS systems for assets management of water supply facilities and Non-Revenue Water management and conducted trainings for FOSS4G (Free and Open Source for Geospatial) applications such as QGIS and PostGIS. I am also heavily involved in FOSS4G community, now I am mainly contributing to translate FOSS4G software such as QGIS/QField, Input, Lizmap to Japanese language. Also, recently, I joined United Nations Vector Tile Toolkit team, hence I developed my own open source software for water utilities in developing countries. Currently, I am a MSc student in University of Leeds, United Kingdom studying water, sanitation and health engineering since September 2021. In addition, I started working in UNDP as an individual GIS consultant from December 2021.
