I started to translate iOS and Android mobile mapping application - [Input](https://inputapp.io) from English to Japanese since January 2021.

In Japan, there are a lot of users who are using iPhone and iPad, however there is no longer available for mobile solution of QGIS in Japan. I finally translated Input app to Japanese language for QGIS community in Japan. Now Japanese users have multipul choices either QField or Input for mobile.
