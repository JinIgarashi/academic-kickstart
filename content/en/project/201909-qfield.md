I started to translate Android mobile mapping application - [QField](https://qfield.org) from English to Japanese since September 2019.

I met Mr. Matthias (OpenGIS.ch) at code sprint of FOSS4G 2019 Bucharest, then I got involved QField project. QField is great tool and very much compatible with QGIS. I wish I can constribute to Japan's QGIS community to use it more and more in field.

You can see some of my translation from [here](https://qfield.org/docs/ja/).
